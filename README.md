 Affordable and Clean Energy ‚Äì AI-Based Multi-Agent Energy Management System

Overview:
This project aims to address **UN Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy** by developing a rule-based **AI multi-agent system** that can optimize energy **generation, storage, distribution, consumption, maintenance, and pricing** ‚Äî making power systems smarter, more reliable, and sustainable.

Objective:
To create an intelligent, automated energy management system that works in real-time and adapts to changing conditions (like weather, demand, pricing) without requiring machine learning.

System Architecture:

Our system consists of six intelligent agents:

1. **Generation Agent** ‚Äì Optimizes energy mix (solar, wind, hydro, gas) based on demand and weather.  
2. **Storage Agent** ‚Äì Manages battery charging/discharging efficiently and safely.  
3. **Distribution Agent** ‚Äì Prioritizes critical zones (e.g., hospitals) and reroutes power during faults.  
4. **Consumption Agent** ‚Äì Suggests energy-saving actions for users to reduce peak load and cost.  
5. **Maintenance Agent** ‚Äì Detects faults, schedules repairs, and prevents outages.  
6. **Pricing Agent** ‚Äì Recommends best energy sourcing strategies based on cost and supply.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Rule-based decision logic**  
- **Weather & pricing data APIs**  
- (Optional) **Smart grid simulation tools**

## üß™ How It Works ‚Äì Example
On a sunny, windy day:
- The **Generation Agent** chooses solar and wind.
- The **Storage Agent** ensures extra power is stored in batteries.
- At night or in bad weather, the system uses **hydro or gas** as backups.
- If a fault occurs, **Distribution Agent** keeps the hospital powered.
- **Maintenance Agent** alerts technicians before a breakdown.
- **Pricing Agent** adjusts sourcing to keep costs low.
  
 Impact:
-  Improved energy access and reliability  
-  Reduced energy bills and operational costs  
-  More renewable integration, lower emissions  
-  Scalable from rural microgrids to urban power networks

 Future Scope:
- Integrate with IoT sensors and smart meters  
- Add predictive analytics for better forecasting  
- Partner with governments/utilities for deployment
